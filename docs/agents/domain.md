# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root — the sailing domain glossary (TWA, TWS, polar, tack, wind zone, ...) mapped to code.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If `docs/adr/` doesn't exist yet, **proceed silently**. Don't flag its absence; don't suggest creating it upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates it lazily when a decision actually gets resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
└── docs/adr/
    ├── 0001-....md
    └── 0002-....md
```

This is a two-folder workspace (`sailplan-app/` the app, `polars/` a standalone fixture generator with no dependency on the app), but only `sailplan-app/` carries a domain model — `polars/` consumes the same vocabulary without adding new terms. `CONTEXT.md` stays a single root-level file rather than being split per-folder, so it can absorb future folders/apps without restructuring.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
